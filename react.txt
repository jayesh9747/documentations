for serching  file by its name -> control + m +p

for making the component -> some step should note that
1) make functional components
2) in component we writing logic in above the return statement
3) in return statement only return the jsx (html)  for writing js use {} bracket 
4) for conditinal rendering use two method -> ternery operator or && operator 
5) hooks return an array of size 2 ->
    arr[0] -> it is a varaible 
    arr[1] -> it a updated function for updating the variable 
6) we directly pass function or write the function don't put bracket after the function name
7) for managing the state -> for managing state we use hooks ethier using of local varible they do not work in component
8) onevent handler we pass the function for handing the event 
9) for passing the data friom the parent to child we uses the props method
10) we passing the function through the props 
11) props are immutable from the children side we can not change the value of props 
12)props is kind of similar to function args 



=> passing children in react component
for passing childern as the html from we use the reactNode type in typescript 

=> styling the React components
->for styling the react component we use seperate file in this folder structure 
and put all vanila css style inside this file 
-> when we use vanila css then make sure that there is css classes become global so that we use anywhere , but it has one disadvantage we can not use this with same name in two different differnt files 
-> so we use the css module method for avoiding this type of error.


=> statemanagement in react 

->React updates state asynchronously. that means sare jo state hote hai woh ek sath last mai jake update hote hai jab component rerender hota hai , one by one state(variable) update nahi hota hai 
->state is stored outside of components
->use hooks at the top level of your component.
->avoid redundant state variables 
->group  related variable inside an object .
->avoid deeply nested structure
-> mantain purity in react components -> how ?
        we delare variable outside the rendering than not update this variable inside the rendering.
        if we declare variable inside the rendering then this is tottaly fine to update this varibale 
-> updating the object using useState -> we can not update the existing object property we give a new object to useState to change whole object because the state is immutable .

for easy implementaion or form data transfromation we use 3 method :
1) useRef hook for refering any data, button , input feild 
2) useState hook : it is used most but when there is complex form then we sholud use the useRef hook 
3) importing the  npm i react-hook-form@7.43 -> it is most easist method for collecting data and sumbiting the data in form of object 

for data validation we use the npm i zod@3.20.6

for featching apis we use the axios module : npm i axios@1.3.4
